**My coworking story:**

I was introduced to coworking via Alex Rudloff, who was evangelizing the concept in Orlando at BarCampOrlando 2004 (the area's first). After hearing about the concept I knew I had to be involved.

We began an informal 'jelly' like event at a local coffeehouse (Stardust) and almost 5 years later it is still growing strong.

We got our first space almost 2 years ago, and while it has strayed more into the area of renting office suites, there is still a community of folks who work in the open 'coworking' area. There is still room for improvement, but I was instrumental in getting the space's vibe established and encouraging 'pure' coworking habits and thinking in the management as well as the members.

I'm moving to Chicago soon, and am looking forward to getting involved in the budding coworking movement there.
