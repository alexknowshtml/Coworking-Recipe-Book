**The thing(s) I want to know about coworking is/are:**

As I was starting up the place, I had a ton of questions, some super basic, some important, some silly. Since others who are starting may have the same questions...here is what I was asking (myself and others):

1. Do I need insurance?
2. If my local insurance agent does not get the concept, where can I get insurance?
3. Can I rent space in a commercial office that I am renting?
4. Do I need bottled water?
5. How do I advertise?
6. How do I explain coworking?
7. Should I cowork or have an office?
8. How much do I charge?
9. What can I do to make it a cool place to work?
10. Would it be better to have a store-front? (Still grappling with that one)
11. Why are my members older?
12. Why are there ZERO telecommuters / commuters?
13. Do I need a Business plan?
14. Should I just open the Tracy Virtual Office (and they will come) or should I do detailed market studies?
15. Did I pick a bad name? (So many cool ones, mine is old-fashioned, a throwback to my old way of thinking).
16. Should I put 100% into this or keep trying to get a teaching job, or technology job?
17. Should I pay someone to clean the bathroom and space?
18. How do I set it up? What will be my "theme"?
19. Where do I buy furniture?
20. How many people can use a single WiFi connection?
21. How cool do I keep it? How warm?
22. Where can I get help / advice? (the google coworkiing list and youtube videos from Citizen Space and others was the answer).

**My coworking story:**

You all may know by now that I have been an advocate / evangelist for "telecommuting" since the...hmmm, 1980's. I co-wrote the first telecommuting plan for Lawrence Livermore National Lab and instantly saw the benefit of it and later, desktop videoconferencing (way back in 1992) for telecommuting. Since then, I have tried to encourage telecommuting and videoconferencing as a productive way to work. 

I spotted an article on "coworking" a little over a year ago (this is written in Dec 2009). I had always wanted to open a "Neighborhood TeleWork Center" (glad I did not since the concept out here in CA never worked) so coworking struck a chord (I wish I could say it was instant, but, I had to throw away some old concepts first so I could embrace the new).

Here I am almost 8 months in (opened May 1, 2009). I have 4 members with several others circling. I suspect this will work and I plan to give it at least 6 months past the original stop deadline since interest is picking up...

Summary

coworking = telecommuting = telework

Save gas, reduce traffic, reduce stress, increase productivity, help save the environment, take back your life!. So many positives, so few negatives.
