**The thing(s) I want to know about coworking is/are:**

I want to know why people call it co-working when in reality most facilities are little more than sub lease deals. This is akin to living an apartment and calling your neighbors family.

**My coworking story:**

I have learned that co-working as a term explains many different things. More often than not it is used to talk about landlord/tenant rental relationships. I believe the true spirit of co-working is about people and not the rental space. We have combated this by finding alternative ways to fund the building and making desk space free. Kind of a permanent Jelly facility.
