**The thing(s) I want to know about coworking is/are:**

* How many committed members did you have before signing a lease on a space?

* Are you breaking even/making a profit?

* What's your percentages of full-time members, part-time members, and drop-ins?

* What was the biggest challenge in getting your space up and running?

**My coworking story**

This story isn't finished yet, but it seems to me that drop-ins are few and far between at the coworking spaces. That is, most business is from full-time members, and most individuals who are working from home, really don't mind working from home. Correlated to that, it seems these individuals come to coworking or jelly "prepared" not to work, but to network more.

Now, after posing this question on the coworking list, I got mostly the people in agreement, but one answer from IndyHall that claimed the contrary. So we'll have to see.

One other thing I've experienced about coworking myself. When I cowork, I have to set a small goal for the day, the assumption being that I'll spend a lot of time, well, talking. This is great, but I think ppl should be able to get as much work done in a space as they would at home. So I think spaces need to separate "quiet" areas and "networking" areas. But we're still debating the issue.
