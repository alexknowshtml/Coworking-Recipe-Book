**The thing(s) I want to know about coworking is/are:**

I'm unable to articulate what I'm trying to learn about coworking as a concept.

I see it as a business opportunity. I love learning about business - and learning & talking about other people's businesses.

I guess if I take that all in -- I'm interested in learning how various types of businesses interact to form bonds and learn from one another to grow their own businesses.

But that's pretty swirly...

**My coworking story:**

I'm a prima donna.

I want to work when i want, where i want, how i want, & with people that i enjoy working with.

I've worked from my home as an executive in a publishing firm for 7+ years. It's been great -- but I need people and the 'buzz' of activity to energize & inspire me.

Working at Office Space Coworking allows me to engage with others and provides me with an creative outlet. I find by interacting with others, I learn from them....they learn from me...and in the end we end up doing better work.

I remember in some random sociology the professor citing a study that a group of relatively smart people will make better decisions than one genius working in isolation. This was later reinforced by my reading of 'Wisdom of Crowds.'

I love the independence that owning your own business provides, but am convinced the only path to success is one that involves leveraging the skills and expertise of peers in a diverse group.
