I am a coworking space catalyst (no permanent space yet)
I'm something else:	
I am a coworking space catalyst (somewhere between no permanent space yet and with a permanent space)

**The thing(s) I want to know about coworking is/are:**
How do you go about filling the space initially? What sort of advertising budget should I allocate?

What is a good threshold of attendance, meaning the number of warm bodies in the space to make it feel like it is working?

Assuming this works, I am interested in offering a group health plan to the space members as something they can buy. Has anyone done anything like this? Successfully?

**My coworking story:**

I work as a web developer in a 5'X8' box in a pool house for a small company. I lack any sort of interaction with similarly minded creative/developer types. I am currently checking out possible locations with the intent of starting sometime in the new year. 

Location: Mechanicsburg, PA. (Near Harrisburg, PA)
