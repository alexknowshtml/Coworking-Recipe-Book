## Determining Square Footage

via [Tara Hunt](http://citizenspace.us)

I've posted this one before (so please forgive me for the repetition). For desks per square feet, I use the following formula:

Break even model: (Cost of space x 1.5 = total cost of space) / (number of square feet / 100 = number of desks) = Cost per desk

Profitable model: (Cost of space x 3 = cost of space and then some) / (number of square feet / 100 = number of desks) = Cost per desk

Of course, there is wiggle room there to make more money on services, drop
ins, conference room rental, event space rental, part time keyholders and other varying levels of membership. Tara

*NOTE: Per Tara, this figure is not just for the working area. This is a general calculation that includes other shared spaces, like coffee room area and restrooms. Your needs may increase if you want additional features, like large conference or auditorium rooms, or full kitchen areas.*
