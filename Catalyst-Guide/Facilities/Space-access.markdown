## Space Access

via [Jerome Chang](http://blankspaces.com)

Hi. Jerome here from L.A. I'm a licensed architect so hopefully these answers will help you.

We have a 5000 sf space, and a 200 Amp panel. Since we have some pretty hefty rooftop A/C units, we're pretty much tapped out: those units consume some 150A, and the rest is for the office. In our case, we're cabled and have wi-fi, have a fridge, projectors, tv's, etc. Cabling is definitely a luxury, but since I have tricked out cubicles, you basically have to invest in cabling upfront or risk having to do surgery to remove desk panels and cable later.

In addition to power, is water and other utilities. What phone/dsl/ video cabling already exists? If you're not the only tenant, where will these feeds arrive into the building. How is it (water, electricity) metered? These all require some coordination with neighboring tenants and the landlord. Old buildings are the most susceptible to utility issues. Line item every CAM (common area maintenance) item so you don't overpay. The landlord might try to swindle more trash $ to pay for someone else's large volume of trash.

Roof and other waterproof conditions are critical, even if it's the landlord's responsibility, you'll suffer the leaks. Many landlords view their properties as a line item in their list of many properties, so their disconnect can be quite appalling when dealing with their lack of concern(s). The less roof and other insulation (single pane vs the better double-paned glass) will sap your electric bills.

Signage. Negotiate that in your lease upfront. Agree on where it will be, etc.

Parking is typically 2 spaces/1000sf. Many spaces that are old or in urban areas will not have this. You pretty much have to negotiate a separate lease with a parking landlord nearby, which is another reason to read the next paragraph...

I would also recommend working with a broker. You don't pay him/her a fee, so you might as well. They have access to MLS database(s) that will cover more properties than Loopnet or Craigslist. Some brokers will even know the landlord, his broker, the building's history, etc. Brokers will also help you negotiate terms in various ways, whether
that be to get the landlord to provide TI (tenant improvement) money, or look out for non-standard/unorthodox lease terms. Lease lawyers will help there, too, but rarely negotiate the lease with the landlord directly, which pits you, probably as a rookie, against seasoned veterans.

A building is basically the most complex computer out there. The utilities are the wiring and circuits. The people are the CPU. Doors, air temp, etc. are all your GUI. So just take a look at the hardware, AND software, and especially the manufacturer - the landlord.
