## How many months of lease did you include in your initial budget calculations? How did the numbers work out for you?

"We didn't really have a budget. We just knew we probably couldn't spend more than $3000/month. We ended up finding a great place for $1500/month and spent 2 months rent on the lease."

**Tara Hunt**, *Citizen Space*, San Francisco

"We have a 3 year lease and we negotiated 3 free months spread out over those 3 years. Oh look at that, it's almost October so we'll get a free month again. Nice!"

**Jacob Sayles**, *Office Nomads*, Seattle Washington

"We didn't have a particularly formal budget, but we looked out six to twelve months in most of my calculations."

**Derek Young**, *Suite133*, Tacoma Washington

"3, and i think we'll be fine "

**Tijs Teulings**, The Hague, Netherlands

"We negotiated our first 2 months free.... So 2 months. ;)
2 months worked out great. We now bring in enough money to cover all of our expenses, including rent."

**Dusty Reagan**, *Conjunctured*, Austin Texas 

"I had budgeted 12 months -- BUT most landlords want 36 minimum. We were able to find someone exiting a lease that had 15 months left on it. This was perfect as it allowed us to offer below asking price (70%) because they were stuck with the bill and just wanted to recoup committed costs on their end.

That and we knew if this didn't fly - we wouldn't have 3 years of lease hanging over our heads.
I think like the others are saying - you have to shop around and look for the right deal. It takes time but if you get a landlord wiling to play ball -- you can generally work something out.
One idea -- I had proposed doing profit sharing with a couple of the landlords and they were very interested.

It's a buyers market for real estate. What I proposed was an Q&A arrangement that allowed us to pay pennies on the dollar + 50% of rental fees per new member UP TO -- 10-15% above their asking price. So the upside was good for them. The downside was they had utilization on a facility that was otherwise vacant. We ended up getting into a historic building which would have messed up some of the tax benefits for our landlord if they had gone that route -- but i'm sure this would have worked on a normal building.

I'm going to try this with our 2nd facility and see how that goes."

**Kelly Brown**, *Office Space Coworking*, Akron Ohio

"We have a 36-month lease."

**Alex Chamberlain**, *Uptime Chico*, Chico California

"We have a 3 year lease and worked out a deal with our landlords that our initial months of rent are at a reduced rate and the difference between actual rent and rent paid is put on top of the money that we owe them."

**Matthew Wettergreen**, *Caroline Collective*, Houston Texas

"We've been offered trial leases by both of our landlords. 6 months in the first spot, 1 year in the second. Both with option to renew without rent increase. We didn't have a specific budget, as many others have said."

**Alex Hillman**, *IndyHall*, Philadelphia PA
