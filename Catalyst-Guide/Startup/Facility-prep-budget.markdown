## What percentage of your starting budget did you allocate to preparing the facility?

"80% ish - we spent about $10,000 total getting the facility prepared, including the furniture, speaker system, mac mini, internet, etc."

**Tara Hunt**, *Citizen Space*, San Francisco

"About 1/2 and some of this is ongoing. The space continues to evolve."

**Jacob Sayles**, *Office Nomads*, Seattle Washington

"50% or so."

**Derek Young**, *Suite133*, Tacoma Washington

"100% i guess. a quite reasonable â‚¬1500 for five seats and a hotdesk and of course some cash for the first few months of rent."

**Tijs Teulings**, The Hague, Netherlands

"Truthfully, zero. We used all of our starting budget to pay the deposit with a bit left over. As we got money from members, we improved the space. Also, after we got rolling we got some modest investment money to help us spruce up the place further."

**Dusty Reagan**, *Conjunctured*, Austin Texas 

"Same as Tara - 80% -- but again - we got lucky."

**Kelly Brown**, *Office Space Coworking*, Akron Ohio

"Between the buildout and the furnishings, we're budgeting $35K."

**Alex Chamberlain**, *Uptime Chico*, Chico California

"All told we had about 20k put in for the renovations and an additional 5k in personal funds that we dumped into the renovations and purchasing items or equipment that we couldn't get donated."

**Matthew Wettergreen**, *Caroline Collective*, Houston Texas

"Everything that wasn't put towards the rent was put into preparing the facility. We made sure to bootstrap as much as possible. In both cases, I'd say 70-80%+ of our startup budget went into buildout. The first office took ~$10,000 (same as citizen space) and the second time our space was nearly 3x larger and we spent a proportional amount on deposits and buildout, between up-front costs and equipment. Everything else continues to evolve was we return to profitable."
