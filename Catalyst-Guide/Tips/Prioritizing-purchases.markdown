## Don't buying stuff that you think you need. Buy what your members need.

via [Alex Chamberlin](http://uptimechico.ning.com/)

TIP: One thing I'd like to echo from Tara; **don't buy anything until your members demand it** (well, okay, I did just buy a great big microwave/ convection oven at a garage sale, but it was only $10 :-)). 

Rent, lease, borrow what you think you'll need until the real world
validates it. As with any new enterprise, you need to work very intimately with your early adopters; they will help you design your program to meet their most urgent requirements, which your mainstream market customers will likely share, for the most part.

We have nine members committed now, with no marketing or promotion (including one person who saw a post here and got in touch); it's all been word of net. They are providing the first level of design input for us. Since this is an extension of our existing operation, we
already have the broadband backbone (which we will multiplex up to four DSL circuits if demand warrants), the high-speed color copier, etc. We also have a pro multimedia production studio, which we are moving into the space, and focusing on entrepreneurs in the New Media/ Web 2.0 space for membership, to leverage our existing investment in the tools, as well as synergizing the concentration of competencies around this market opportunity.

Since we're colocated with a casual dining operator (the best pizza in the time zone, with an espresso bar cafe in the morning), we're only furnishing a fridge and a nuke. We expect most people will get get their refreshment needs fulfilled by Celestino's downstairs, which
will also serve as overflow space should we get very crowded. Good luck with your program! - Alex Chamberlain
