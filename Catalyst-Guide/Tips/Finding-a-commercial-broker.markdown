## On Finding a Commercial Broker

via [Heather O'Sullivan](http://www.heathero.com/)

I am very new at this too, so I can't answer most of your questions! However, I can tell you that you should find a broker to help you and look out for things yourself as well. I would be happy to refer you to a broker in your area if you'd like (if you don't like them, just don't use them!). Referred clients often get a higher level of service, so if that would help you, just let me know!

Without a broker, there are a few basic things to ask about commercial properties: 

Are there CAM fees and what do they include? 

What are you responsible for in terms of repairs (usually everything inside the doors, sometimes the doors themselves, the HVAC unit, etc)

What improvements are you allowed to make and what will you have to change/remove if/when you vacate
