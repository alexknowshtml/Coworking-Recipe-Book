This survey was sent by a Canadian undergrad. He's doing a research paper on eco-friendly business solutions and wanted to know how coworking compares to traditional office rentals, as well as the potential environmental effects of coworking.

# How long have you been involved in co-working?

Since August 2006.

# How did you first get involved? Why? (E.g. Environment, Creativity, money, networking etc).

I was a freelancer working from home, thinking there must be a better way. I did some work with Chris Messina and Tara Hunt, co-founders of CitizenSpace in San Francisco and learned about coworking through their involvement with early evangelism of the idea. I failed at an attempt to move to San Francisco and instead took the opportunity to reflect and see why I could/should stay. I saw coworking as an excellent vehicle to improve the quality of the work community for independents, freelancers, and entrepreneurs in Philadelphia.

# What do you think the benefits of co-working are to business centers?  Do you see many parallels between the two?

Business centers offer business services. Coworking is about community, and the interactions between members of the community.

Businesses centers are often economic, or real-estate driven. Coworking can serve those needs, but people need to come first.

Coworking is NOT a new model, it's just a new audience for an old model. Artists have been collaborating in community centers and spaces for thousands of years. Businesses now can take advantage of all lessons learned, including mistakes made in artist communities.

# What professions are the typical buyers?

Our community was largely tech and creative early on, but that's only because that's who we knew. Now, we have:
Designers, developers, writers, artists, entrepreneurs, scientists, educators, small business owners, telecommuters, marketers, videographers, game developers, writers, and more.

# How long is the average contract length? What are the maximum and minimum periods of a contract?

We operate on month-to-month memberships, not contracts. 

# How do you work out a price per desk? What is your average price?

Our price per desk was engineered from the initial community that we spent nearly a year surveying. We knew the price point that the market could bear, and it needed to be approachable. Reversing the math allowed us to figure out the right size space to sustain.

Our rates range from $275/month to $25/day. We do not do hourly usage because we don't believe in renting desks. Becoming a part of the community doesn't happen at an hourly rate.

We also introduced the "Basic Membership" that has been adopted by many spaces. We had a larger community than just desk users, and they wanted to see the space operate as a community center. We allowed them to pay $25/month as an association fee, allowing them to operate as members and gain member benefits. Many people pay for multiple months upfront (which was one of the ways we raised capital in the first place) and rarely, if ever, actually utilize desks.

Abstracting membership from the desks is one of the best things we've ever done.

# How is co-working environmentally friendly?

Shared resources is intrinsically environmentally friendly. It's a corollary benefit to everything else that coworking enables.

# Is co-working “desk space rental”?

Absolutely not. 

# How do you advertise?

We get involved with the community that we represent. We've thrown hundreds of events over the last 3 years, and those events are our primary source of promotion. We've never spent a dime on advertising.

# How do clients normally find you?

90% or more of our members found us through word of mouth.

# Why would individuals chose to pay for a space when they can go to a coffee shop instead? What do you offer that a coffee shop does not?

You cannot turn to the person sitting next to you in a coffee shop and have a meaningful conversation about work, or life, or much of anything. Coworking provides a valuable context for being around other people.

# Are there any negative aspects of co-working?

Besides its addictive qualities? Coworking is NOT for everybody, but I don't necessarily see that as a negative aspect.

# Are there any problems with security?

In a community-first coworking space, everybody is always on the lookout for everybody else. In 2+ years and literally hundreds of people through our doors, we've only had one theft, and it was situational. The victim's loss was unfortunate and it was a violation of the trust of the community, but we recovered quickly.

# Where do you see co-working 10 years from now?

In 10 years, I see coworking as more than just "centers" for coworking activities. I hope coworking is able to change the way people work, and the way companies operate their offices. Again, it's not about WHERE people work, but how they work. Coworking puts the social back into the workplace, an important aspect to the work day. I think coworking will not necessarily drive, but contribute largely to the next major shift in workplace/workforce.
