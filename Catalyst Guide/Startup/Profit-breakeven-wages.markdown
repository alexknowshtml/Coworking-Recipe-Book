## Does your space represent a profit (by that, I mean your wage comes from the space) center, or do you run it as a break-even and have your own business or job on the side for primary income? Do you know what the norm is for space owners?

"No profit here. We make a little extra money, but it really goes back into the space itself. And, yes, Citizen Space is supported by Citizen Agency, my consultancy. There are a few spaces I know of that people can draw a salary from, but no wildly profitable ones."

"Right now we run it as break-even and have our own businesses. However, we have plans to scale it so it creates a profit.
Although we're break even at the moment. We (there's 4 of us) run the space like startup. We have marketing and operational budgets, balanced books, waterfall financial projections, weekly management meetings, and we even have an advisory board. We spend alot of time working on Conjunctured."

"Our model is designed to generate surplus cash to support our other programs. We're a private, non-profit organization promoting economic development through venture investment. We see CoWorking as being a new model for business incubation, and while our primary outcomes will be the development of growth stage technology companies, we also believe this has the potential to throw cash. We have a partnership
with the Department of Management at the College of Business at the local California State University. They have an entrepreneurship major (an minor) with a 3-unit internship elective. The plan is to send their intern candidates to us for mentoring and coaching, while putting them to task staffing the studio and supporting other entrepreneurs."

"We operate at breakeven or better, and all profit goes back into evolving the business and growing the community. Geoff and I do not take a wage from the business. We contract an office manager part time. Details on how that works are at: http://www.indyhall.org/blog/2009/08/06/how-indyhall-got-the-best-office- manager-without-hiring-an-office-manager/ "
