## Do you have any advice to share on getting started with a commercial real estate broker? Did you do the research on your own, or did you rely on an agent to find spaces? Any things to look out for when hunting for the space that might not be obvious? I know it's important to verify that the facility can handle power load.

"Craigslist all the way...but I realize not all areas have the same advantage. We also walked around the areas of the cities we liked and called numbers on signs regardless of the broker."

"We did some research on our own, but having a professional commercial real estate agent made all the difference in the world. Highly recommend you use one."

**Dusty Reagan**, *Conjunctured*, Austin Texas 

"I think walking around to find spaces is best, in conjunction with craiglist. Not just because you can get a feel for a landlord much better if you are hands on, but you'll be able to tell if getting to that neighborhood is easy or not. If it's a pain to get to the CoWorking space, nobody will want to get there. "
