## Aside from rent and equipment, were there any other financial gotcha's that
really stood out or were unexpected? Did people consume 7 times as much coffee as you expected, for instance. Also, because of the heavy computer load, how accurate were any power utility estimates that you forecast?

"RE setup cost gotchas: What people SAY they want and what they actually end up needing is quite different. Everyone told us: must have photocopier/fax machine. After two years, people have asked 2x for a photocopier and 4x for a fax machine. For this, we sent them to the Kinkos a block away. Coffee?
Well, we had grand plans of a fancy coffee bar in-house, but people really enjoy getting up and walking a couple of blocks in the middle of the workday to get a coffee...it's a break."

"Our financial gotcha was our central heat and air. We had to spend $1100 to get it working. Then we found out it just doesn't have the oomph to cool our poorly insulated house in the Texas heat when more than 10 people are working. To combat this we purchased two 1 ton floor air-conditioners for $300 each. The old house needs better insulation, and probably a bigger compressor. But the floor units have solved our AC problems cheaply for now."

"Central air is killing us this summer. I called the electric company and asked them to spread out our summer bills, and they obliged."
