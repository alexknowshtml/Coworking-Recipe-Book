## Where did you get your office furniture? Did you involve the interested community in donating items, did you buy surplus, used, auction, new?

"Ikea...except for our chandelier, which I found on eBay for $299 freight included"

**Tara Hunt**, *Citizen Space*, San Francisco

"We put the word out in every direction and found a lot of folks donating usable stuff. We supplemented this with Ikea and stuff we've built... our conference table is BEAUTIFUL and we are so proud."

**Jacob Sayles**, *Office Nomads*, Seattle Washington

"The used office furniture store had an amazing inventory of new and used industrial-strength conference tables and file cabinets for cheap. Cheaper than Craigslist for the same furniture in many cases. Plus, they delivered, carried it up the stairs, and install it all.
Ikea dining tables are used as desks. Furniture from our homes and past businesses. A new red leather sofa donated by a friend."

**Derek Young**, *Suite133*, Tacoma Washington

"50% from thrift stores, 50% from ikea. we had a good deal on desks made from builders wood (if that is what it's called in english)" 

**Tijs Teulings**, The Hague, Netherlands

"We have donated items, we have surplus items, IKEA items, and some REALLY nice couches from IF+D."

**Dusty Reagan**, *Conjunctured*, Austin Texas 

"We tried to do IKEA - but that was a BIG old pain for us. They have horrible customer service - don't allow for large orders either online or on the phone and the lead time for getting anything was like 4-6 weeks. We found somethings that worked at Kmart & Target' - of all places - they were cheaper and shipped the same day. And they look great.

I think the key for us was having an open mind with respect to the furniture -- we're using mini-dinnette tables called 'parsons' tables. They work perfect as work tables -- nice finish, good size and we can re-orient them pretty easily.

**Kelly Brown**, *Office Space Coworking*, Akron Ohio

"We're getting some stuff used/garage sale/craigslist. We're also partnering with a local independent office furniture company to furnish the rest of our needs on a lease-to-own basis, with the option to swap out stuff we don't need for stuff we do (the mix of desks to study carrels to cafe tables & chairs, say)."

**Alex Chamberlain**, *Uptime Chico*, Chico California


"It's amazing how many people/businesses have functional but old office furniture. We started with donations and have built additional desks to fill the CoWorking space. Craigslist is a great place to start if you have a craigslist culture in your city, otherwise estate sales and close contacts are the best way to find office furniture."

**Matthew Wettergreen**, *Caroline Collective*, Houston Texas

"Craigslist, ikea, and donations. Electronics came almost entirely from newegg.com and monoprice.com We were blown away by community support, and even a number of businesses that went out of their way (like Belkin) to help us by donating materials. We got some old school lockers on craigslist. Our conference room table came from a local sustainable property developer, though we found that on craigslist as well"

**Alex Hillman**, *IndyHall*, Philadelphia PA
