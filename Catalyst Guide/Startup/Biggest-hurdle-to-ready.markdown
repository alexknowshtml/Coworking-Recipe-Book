## What was the biggest obstacle to getting your space ready to work?

"Finding the right place that was such an awesome deal."

**Tara Hunt**, *Citizen Space*, San Francisco

"Keeping sane. Susan and I both prioritize personal mental/emotional health over all else. We work at a fast pace at times but always check in on each other and ourselves to make sure we are sustainable overall. We regularly hand things back and forth when things get too much for us and I can't imagine doing it any other way. This is kind of built in since we both have part time jobs unrelated to Office Nomads so everything needs to be able to be put down.
With personal sanity in check all other obstacles are easy and fun."

**Jacob Sayles**, *Office Nomads*, Seattle Washington

"Finding an appropriately sized space that was mostly finished at the right Once the right balance was found, the rest fell together nicely."

**Derek Young**, *Suite133*, Tacoma Washington

"i guess we just started last week so i haven't run into any snags yet :)"

**Tijs Teulings**, The Hague, Netherlands

"We're bootstrapped, and pretty much had no money getting started. Makes things pretty tricky."

**Dusty Reagan**, *Conjunctured*, Austin Texas 

"Finding the right location. This took 3 months for us and trying to be patient through that process was difficult.

Also - the business plan (funding) -- I was simultaneously writing the plan to get SBA funding -- business plans are a pain but they are powerful and force you articulate everything in excruciating detail. It paid off and we got an SBA loan within 4 days of submission -- I *like* to think that's because we spent so much time & research getting it right.
Now that we're ready to launch -- that's the fun part -- and where the rubber meets the road. The furniture, the marketing, the planning -- this is the part i'm really enjoying most. "

**Kelly Brown**, *Office Space Coworking*, Akron Ohio

"The biggest delay factor has been getting our funding approved by the local workforce investment board. They were totally supportive from the start, but bureaucracies run slow. But it's all green light now."

**Alex Chamberlain**, *Uptime Chico*, Chico California

"This answer will differ depending on the space and the geographic location. If the answer is "not having enough support for the project" then this is a good indication that more planning and community building needs to be done to ensure the initial success of the space. Maintaining sanity will always be an issue if you are poor at dealing with stress (as my partner and I are) and like Jacob and Susan it was only through mutual support that we got through it. For most people though I think the most difficult part is finding a space that works
for them based on their budget and initial support. That period can in some cases take longer than the preparation of the space which follows, personally, we were very lucky in finding our space immediately and painlessly. "

**Matthew Wettergreen**, *Caroline Collective*, Houston Texas

"Finding a space that fit our needs, our price per square foot target, the right neighborhood, along with a landlord that "got it" was the biggest challenge. Having a landlord on your side can change your life, your business, your world. We've gotten lucky, twice."

**Alex Hillman**, *IndyHall*, Philadelphia PA
