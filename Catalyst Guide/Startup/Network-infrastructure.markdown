## Did you go wireless exclusively, or did you provide ethernet connections? And if you did, did you spend the money to have these inset, or did you run cable and use switches/routers?

"We are totally wireless. One router from one connection."

**Tara Hunt**, *Citizen Space*, San Francisco

"We are both wired and ethernet. The space was mostly wired but we needed to run some more here and there for the doors and such. We are in a dense residential area so wireless is tricky. We even have some of the best wifi guys around (seattle wireless, shmoo, defcon guys) trying to help us out but with this much traffic it's never going to be perfect. Folks like the wire." 

**Jacob Sayles**, *Office Nomads*, Seattle Washington

"We're exclusively wireless. The exception is if folks want to plug into a router next to the printer. It happens infrequently, but it happens."

**Derek Young**, *Suite133*, Tacoma Washington

"wireless. on a 20mbit ADSL line."

**Tijs Teulings**, The Hague, Netherlands

"We're running business class cable on a Airport Extreme with an Airport Express as a repeater. We also use the Express to take turns streaming iTunes to the stereo. Sometimes people have wireless issues with their laptops and have to plug into the router via cable. We have plans to add business class DSL from a separate provider on a different wireless router to add some redundancy.

**Dusty Reagan**, *Conjunctured*, Austin Texas 
 
We're primarily wireless. We have ethernet -- but that is mostly for VoIP telephones."

**Kelly Brown**, *Office Space Coworking*, Akron Ohio

"We're going with a high capacity WAP plus gigabit hardwire ethernet connections for those who want them; DSL backbone."

**Alex Chamberlain**, *Uptime Chico*, Chico California

"We have four Netgear WAPs that blanket the entire 15,000sqft lot with wireless. We also had cables re-run to all of the offices in Caroline although no one is using a hardline connection in the entire building."

**Matthew Wettergreen**, *Caroline Collective*, Houston Texas

"We went wireless for a while, until we passed 15 or so simultaneous connections. Being in a neighborhood with lots of other wifi, our router kept losing connections over wifi, and often times completely crashing. We went through several different makes and models
Q&A before settling on the D-Link Wireless N Gaming router, it was fast enough to support lots of concurrent connections and configurable enough for our needs. Until, we decided to run gigabit to almost every desk, which we did in a makeshift arrangement of 4 and 8 port netgear switches, and cable strung around the office. It wasn't pretty, but it worked. Our new office, we decided to go gigabit from the beginning and designed a custom cable hanging solution, allowing us to install home runs to every desk back to a patch bay. In addition to the gigabit every desk has, we have two Apple Airport extreme routers that have been EXTREMELY stable and reliable. We use one to cover each of our two main work areas. "
