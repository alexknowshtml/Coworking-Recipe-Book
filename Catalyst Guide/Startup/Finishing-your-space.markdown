## How much finishing did you require in order to get your space functional?

"Our space was really raw when we found it, but our landlord was awesome in helping us get it ready. We paid for some of the materials and he paid for most and the installation. It took about a month to get it up to speed, putting in new bamboo floors, painting the walls, installing new lights and building a new wall that would separate the small boardroom in the back from the main space."

**Tara Hunt**, *Citizen Space*, San Francisco

"Not much at all. Our original space would have required a serious charm infusion and 3 months to get there but this place was ready to go day 1 and we opened the doors after having keys for just 3 weeks. We've done a ton since then to give it our own personal touch but very little structural work was needed." 

**Jacob Sayles**, *Office Nomads*, Seattle Washington

"The biggest expense was fixing the shoddy electrical work of a previous tenant. Other than that, we rehung some trim, replaced some drywall in our "printer nook", bought furniture, hung art, and considered ourselves open for business. We still need to replace some light fixtures, improve the plumbing situation, and install an access control system."

**Derek Young**, *Suite133*, Tacoma Washington

"just some paint. and of course furniture, fridge, etc. for art we are doing a rotating system where we hang up new art from local artists every few months which is for sale as well." 

**Tijs Teulings**, The Hague, Netherlands

"We leased an old house built in 1918. It was in great condition when we got it. We had the interior repainted and gave it a good cleaning. Other than that, it was ready to go." 

**Dusty Reagan**, *Conjunctured*, Austin Texas 

We lucked out -- we found a place that was perfect that only needed some touch ups. I had budgeted $10k though"

**Kelly Brown**, *Office Space Coworking*, Akron Ohio

"New carpeting, some walls and doors (conference/meeting rooms), new lighting (track instead of fluorescent tubes). "

**Alex Chamberlain**, *Uptime Chico*, Chico California

"Our space required a great deal of work to get it to a vanilla box state. Significant demolition of standing walls, rebuilding of new walls, replacement of new doors, removal of carpet, tile and concrete preparation and staining, new paint on all horizontal surfaces, powerwashing of the exterior surfaces, new locks on all exterior and interior doors, removal of several structurally unsound sheds and overhangs in the back lot, replacement of the A/C on one of the buildings, and an asbestos check."

**Matthew Wettergreen**, *Caroline Collective*, Houston Texas

"Our first space was more or less ready to go. We had 3 weeks from lease signing to opening, and that was to get/build desks, set up some furniture, and test out layouts. The majority of the changes made to the space were done in the 18 months after we opened, as we needed them. Our second space required more work, including buildout provided by the landlord, and some painting and construction done by us. Again, nearly everything done to get us to functional was completed in 3 weeks, and we've continued building things out while the space is operational. "
