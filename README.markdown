## Coworking Recipe Book 

Unhappy with the state of resources and the lack of a true repository for answers to frequently asked questions, we're working on compiling something better.

The end result's format is still to be discovered. A traditional "How To" or guidebook may become a part of it, but that's not really the goal at this point. 

A recipe book is one of the more appropriate metaphors, because it allows each set of "delicious ideas" to be "flavored to taste". A recipe book CAN be a guide, but true cuisine uses them as reference and inspiration.

Expect documentation of successes.

Expect documentation of failures.

We're publishing all of my research while its being compiled for (at least) four reasons:

1. The public insight and social pressure will help keep us accountable.
2. The raw information, and even organizing it, has intrinsic value separate from the goal of synthesizing it. 
3. It should be easy for others to see the base they are contributing to, with hopes of it guiding their input and contribution.
4. Coworking is "open source" by nature. The natural spread of coworking comes from the notion of creating central repositories for knowledge and experiences (like this project), and making them available, with the simple expectation that in return, you contribute back. This project embodies that.
